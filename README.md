Examples of using tools to examine and optimize container images.

## Tools we'll look at

* [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)

## Examples

* `python-app/` - demonstrate `hadlolint` rule and `dive` tool
* `nodejs-app/` - demonstrate `slim` and `alpine` variants of base image
* `golang-app/` - demonstrate multi-stage builds
